      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>After putting my life on hold to finally finish my undergrad as a very-adult human, I graduated with an English degree into this lovely COVID-ravaged job market. I decided on coding bootcamp as a way to beef up my skill set and become a more desirable hire. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in South Texas and finished high school, massage school, and college in Southern California. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a self-taught ukulele enthusiast, I love digital illustration, though I'm not very good at it. I got into indoor bouldering right before the plague dropped and I'm excited to get back into that once I get my turn at a vaccine. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd love to find myself doing some combination of coding and technical writing.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Pittsburgh, PA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The work sounds very satisfying and I love learning new thigns and gaining new high-utility skills.</p>
